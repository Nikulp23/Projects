    <h1>UniFit - A Fitness Website</h1>
   
    <img src="Unfit_transparent.png" height="300" width="300" class="center">


    <p>Our Application is designed to help users create a fitness plan and track it. Using their inputs 
        for their height, weight, and desired goal from the website, the website will give a weekly 
        based fitness plan that includes the name of the exercise and a short description on how to
        do it with the right form. Users will first log in or sign up if they do not already have 
        an account. If it is the users first time on the website, they will enter their details 
        like height, weight, gender, and their main goal which is one of the 3: Lose Weight, Get 
        Toned, Get Flexible. </p>

    <p>Our prototype is a fitness app that helps users to achieve their fitness goals by providing personalized
        workout plans based on their body details and goals. Upon opening the app, users are asked to 
        either login or sign up if they don't have an account. If they don't have an account, they are 
        asked to create one and enter their body details such as weight, height, age and time available
        for workouts. After this, users are asked about their fitness goals, such as weight loss, muscle 
        gain, or overall fitness such as flexibility, and are then provided with a weekly workout plan for
        their goals. The workout plans include exercises with video links to ensure proper form and technique.
        The application will later feature a progress tracker that allows users to log their workouts and
        monitor their progress after every week. Overall, the prototype is designed to help users 
        achieve their fitness goals by providing personalized workout plans.
