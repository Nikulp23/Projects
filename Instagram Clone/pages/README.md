2110 Term Project - Team 15

Welcome to RPost!

RPost intends to bring the RPI community closer and more connected. Through the official RPost social media platform, users can post what is on their mind and interact with each other. RPost also offers uniformity by organizing all important RPI information into one easy to access platform with the RPI Events feature. 

We have used a variety of tools to develope this application including CSS, HTML, JS, PHP, SQL, and XAMPP.
